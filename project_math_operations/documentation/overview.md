# Simple Math Operations Application (Command Line)

The `main.py` file contains a simple script that imports `print_operations` and defines a `main` function. 

The `main` function prompts the user to input two numbers and then calls the `print_operations.print_operations` function with these numbers as arguments. 

This script is intended to be the entry point of a Python program, indicated by the conditional statement `if __name__ == "__main__":` which calls the `main` function when the script is executed directly.

The math_operations.py file contains definitions for basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each function takes two arguments, a and b, performs the respective arithmetic operation, and returns the result. The division function includes a check to prevent division by zero.

The print_operations.py file contains a single function, print_operations, which imports the functions from math_operations.py and uses them to print out the results of arithmetic operations on two numbers provided as arguments.

Type hints in Python are provided by the built-in typing module, which includes a range of type hints and special constructs for static type checking. For the basic types like float, int, str, etc., you do not need to import anything; they are available as built-in types in Python. However, for more complex types like List, Dict, Optional, and so forth, you would need to import the appropriate classes from the typing module.

## Application Structure

Below is the directory and file layout for the application:

- project/
  - tests/
    - __init__.py
    - test_math_operations.py      # Unit tests for the math operations module
    
  - source/
    - __init__.py                    # Initializes the source as a package
    - main.py                        # Main application entry point
    - print_operations.py            # Module for print operations
    - math_operations.py             # Module for math operations

# Summary and assessment of each test:

## test_integration.py

Focuses on testing both arithmetic operations and their printing functionalities.
Uses capsys to capture and assert printed output, covering logic and output aspects.

## test_integration_mo_po.py

Tests the output of the print_operations function for each arithmetic operation.
Similar to test_integration.py, it uses capsys for output verification.

## test_main.py

Tests user input functionality in the main module.
Uses unittest.mock.patch to simulate user input, ensuring correct type conversion and tuple return.

## test_math_operations.py

Contains unit tests for basic arithmetic functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) in the math_operations module.
Focuses solely on the correctness of mathematical operations.

## test_po.py

Primary focus on print outputs of arithmetic operations.
Ensures both correct calculations and accurate printed representations.

## test_print_operations.py

Uses unittest.mock to test the print_operations function with mocked arithmetic operations.
Ensures the correct handling of outputs and their print representations.
